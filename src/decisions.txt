1. Tech Stack:

   *Java
   *Spring Boot
   *MySql
   *Hibernate

2. Database Schema:

   *A single table, number_sequence, is used to store the category code and value.
   *The table has three columns: id (auto-generated), category_code, and value.

3. Fetching Next Number:

   *The fetchNextNumber API method searches the number_sequence table for the given categoryCode.
   *If the record is found, the current value is fetched. If not found, a new record is created with a default value of 0.
   *The next number is generated by incrementing the value and checking if the sum of its digits is either 1 or 10.
   *Once the new value is calculated, it is updated in the table and the old and new values are returned in the response.

4. Delay Simulation:

   *A delay of 5 seconds is introduced using TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(5).

5. Unit Testing:

   *JUnit and Mockito frameworks are used for unit testing.
   *Test cases cover different scenarios, including valid requests, edge cases, and error conditions.

6. Git Usage:

   *Git version control system is used to manage the project codebase.
   *Frequent commits with descriptive messages are made to track the development progress.
